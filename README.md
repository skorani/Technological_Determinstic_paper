The premise of this paper is technological
determinism from a linguistic perspective. According to
complexity theory in the network society, the social network is a
representation of society. This paper collects a corpus of tweets
and extracts topics using LDA; after that, extract the network of
users and their tweet's topics using Dynamic evolving network
based on time of tweets. Finally, estimate the correlation of
networks by Multivariate Regression Analysis. The result proves
technological determinism that means technology changes
society's awareness and constructs a new society.
